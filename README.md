### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Vladislav
#### I am an iOS developer
My acquaintance with programming began with the Kotlin programming language and I was very interested in mobile development. In October 2022, I started developing IOS and continue to do so. I am very interested in this topic and try to post all my projects that I do here. Thank you for your attention!
